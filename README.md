This repository is a collection of open-source nodes and workflows for ComfyUI, a dev tool that allows users to create node-based workflows often powered by various AI models to do pretty much anything.

Our mission is to seamlessly connect people and organizations with the world’s foremost AI innovations, anywhere, anytime. 
Our vision is to foster a flourishing AI ecosystem where the world’s best developers can build and share their work, thereby redefining how software is made, pushing innovation forward, and ensuring as many people as possible can benefit from the positive promise of AI technologies.

We believe that ComfyUI is a powerful tool that can help us achieve our mission and vision, by enabling anyone to explore the possibilities and limitations of AI models in a visual and interactive way, without coding if desired.

We hope that by sharing our nodes and workflows, we can inspire and empower more people to create amazing AI-powered content with ComfyUI.
